            Jupiter is the largest planet in our Solar System, known for its
            immense size and striking features. With a diameter of about 86,900
            miles (139,800 kilometers), it is a gas giant predominantly composed
            of hydrogen and helium. Jupiter's atmosphere is renowned for its
            dynamic and colorful cloud bands, driven by its rapid rotation,
            which creates a dramatic striped appearance.
